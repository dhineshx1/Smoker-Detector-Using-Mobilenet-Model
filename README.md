# SMOKER DETECTOR USING MOBILENET MODEL

This project aims to develop an AI system for  detection of smoking incidents through image analysis. The system utilizes a MobileNetV3-based deep learning model, trained on a diverse dataset comprising 2000 images, with a balanced distribution of smoking and non-smoking scenarios. An essential focus is on mitigating regional bias, particularly adapting the model for effective performance in the American context.
